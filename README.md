# hits-Quiz

## Task
I had to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Approach

I used the activites and help from the assistance for this task. Going over the activites and doing some extra google search helped with this task. I used external websites like stack-overflow, mdm, and chatgpt etc. These tools helped me develop the code I have so far.
